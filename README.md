OSC99
=====

OSC99 is a highly portable ANSI C99 compliant OSC library developed for use with embedded systems.  OSC99 implements the [OSC 1.0 specification](http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0") including all optional argument types.  The library also includes a [SLIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Line_Internet_Protocol)  module for encoding and decoding OSC packets via unframed protocols such as UART/serial.
